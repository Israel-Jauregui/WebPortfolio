    Hello! My name is Israel Jauregui and I am a student at the University of North Georgia studying Computer Science with a minor in math. I am extremely passionate about the area of programming as well as statistics. This website is designed to showcase the areas I am most passionate about with projects that showcase my abilities. Outside of my classes I lead the operations for the school's programming club CodingWarriors as President. Go NightHawks!
